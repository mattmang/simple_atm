Assignment: Create a Simple ATM System in Python

Objective:
To develop a basic ATM system using Python that allows users to perform essential banking operations such as checking balance, depositing money, and withdrawing money.

Requirements:
User Authentication:
Implement a simple login system where users can log in with a predefined account number and PIN.
Use a hardcoded account number and PIN for this assignment (e.g., Account Number: 123456, PIN: 1234).
Main Menu:

After successful login, display a menu with the following options:
Check Balance
Deposit Money
Withdraw Money
Exit

Functions:
Create functions for each operation:
check_balance(balance): Displays the current balance.
deposit(balance, amount): Increases the balance by the deposit amount.
withdraw(balance, amount): Decreases the balance by the withdrawal amount if sufficient funds are available.

Data Validation:
Ensure that the deposit and withdrawal amounts are positive numbers.
When withdrawing, ensure that the user has sufficient funds.
Loop Until Exit:

Allow the user to perform operations until they choose to exit the program.

Error Handling:
Handle invalid input gracefully (e.g., non-numeric values for amounts).

Implementation Steps:
Start by defining a main function that will handle the user interaction.
Create a loop for the main menu that keeps running until the user chooses to exit.
Implement the functions required for each banking operation.
Ensure to maintain and update the userâ€™s balance throughout the session.
